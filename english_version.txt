I worked as a project manager in a financial regulatory system. At the beginning of the project, I invited the business person to talk about the needs of the project to describe the user story. After collecting the user stories, I and the team to calculate the story of each user's story and the story of the user to sort. After that, I and the team estimate the rate of iteration. At this rate we arranged several rounds of iteration. After that, we started the first iteration. At the beginning of the iteration, we discuss the need to complete the user stories in the iteration.
